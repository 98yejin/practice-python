# MultipleQuestionsHandler

## Overview

MultipleQuestionsHandler is a Python class designed to interact with the Anthropic API to handle and respond to multiple questions asynchronously. This script uses the power of the Anthropic AI, specifically the "claude-3-opus-20240229" model, to generate intelligent and context-aware responses. The class is built using aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests and asyncio for handling asynchronous operations.

## Features

- Asynchronous API Calls: Utilizes asyncio and aiohttp for efficient non-blocking calls to the Anthropic API.
- Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to manage exceptions and API response errors.
- Scalability: Designed to handle multiple questions simultaneously, making it scalable for larger loads.
- Customizable: Allows specifying the AI model, making it adaptable for different versions or types of models provided by Anthropic.

## Configuration

Configuration settings like the API key and questions are stored in a config.json file located in the same directory as the script. The JSON structure should be:

```json
{
  "api-key": "your_api_key_here",
  "questions": ["What is the weather today?", "How does quantum computing work?"]
}
```

## Methods Description

generate_response: Takes a question and generates a response using the specified model of the Anthropic API.
form_responses: Aggregates multiple responses into a single formatted string.
ask: Manages the process of sending multiple questions and compiling their responses.

## Output

The script prints the compiled responses to the console, where each response is separated by two newlines.
